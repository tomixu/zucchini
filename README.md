[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/zucchini-ios.png)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/zucchini-ios)

## Requirements

 1. Mac OS X 10.6 or newer
 2. XCode 4.2 or newer
 3. Ruby 1.9.3 or newer
 4. A few command line tools which can be installed with [homebrew](http://brew.sh/):

```
brew update && brew install imagemagick node
npm install -g coffee-script
```

## Start using Zucchini

```
gem install zucchini-ios
```

Using Zucchini doesn't involve making any modifications to your application code.
You might as well keep your Zucchini tests in a separate project.

To create a project scaffold:

```
zucchini generate --project /path/to/my_project
```

Then to create a feature scaffold for your first feature:

```
zucchini generate --feature /path/to/my_project/features/my_feature
```

Start developing by editing `features/my_feature/feature.zucchini` and `features/support/screens/welcome.coffee`.

Make sure you check out the [zucchini-demo](https://github.com/zucchini-src/zucchini-demo) project featuring an easy to explore Zucchini setup around Apple's CoreDataBooks sample.

## Running on the device

Add your device to `features/support/config.yml`.

The [udidetect](https://github.com/vaskas/udidetect) utility comes in handy if you plan to add devices from time to time: `udidetect -z`.

```
ZUCCHINI_DEVICE="My Device" zucchini run /path/to/my_feature
```
You can set one of the devices to be used by default in `config.yml` so that you can avoid setting `ZUCCHINI_DEVICE` each time:

```
devices:
  My Device:
	default: true
	...
```

## Running on the iOS Simulator

We encourage you to run your Zucchini features on real hardware. However you can also run them on the iOS Simulator.

First off, modify your `features/support/config.yml` to include the path to your compiled app (relative or absolute), e.g.

```
app: ./Build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/CoreDataBooks.app
```

Secondly, add a simulator device entry (no UDID needed) and make sure you provide the actual value for `screen` based on your iOS Simulator settings:

```
devices:
  My Simulator:
    screen: retina_ios7
    simulator: iPhone Retina (4-inch) - Simulator - iOS 7.1
    ...
```

Retrive a complete list of local supported simualtor version run following command on your command line:

```
  instruments -w sda
```

You can also override the app path per device:

```
devices:
  iPad2:
    screen: ipad_ios6
    app: ./Build/Products/Debug-iphoneos/CoreDataBooks.app
```

Note that `config.yml` is compiled through ERB so that you can use environment variables, e.g.

```erb
app: <%= ENV['ZUCCHINI_APP'] %>
```


Run Zucchini and watch the simulator go!

```
ZUCCHINI_DEVICE="My Simulator" zucchini run /path/to/my_feature
```
